### Description

It has been proven that when you see a happy face, it also makes you smile or be happy as well, which is part of positive thinking and causes you to live longer. This program displays a yellow happy face on the screen, always on top of other windows. It moves to a different random location when you move the mouse over it. This code demonstrates how to make a window on top, move the form on the screen, and how to make certain parts of the form transparent. Good luck and be happy!
